= zmq_atomic_counter_destroy(3)


== NAME
zmq_atomic_counter_destroy - destroy an atomic counter


== SYNOPSIS
*void zmq_atomic_counter_destroy (void **counter_p);*


== DESCRIPTION
The _zmq_atomic_counter_destroy_ function destroys an atomic counter and
nullifies its reference. Pass the address of an atomic counter (void **)
rather than the counter itself. You must destroy all counters that you
create, to avoid memory leakage. This function uses platform specific
atomic operations.


== RETURN VALUE
The _zmq_atomic_counter_destroy()_ function has no return value.


== EXAMPLE
.Test code for atomic counters
----
void *counter = zmq_atomic_counter_new ();
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_value (counter) == 0);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_inc (counter) == 0);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_inc (counter) == 1);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_inc (counter) == 2);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_value (counter) == 3);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_dec (counter) == 1);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_dec (counter) == 1);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_dec (counter) == 0);
zmq_atomic_counter_set (counter, 2);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_dec (counter) == 1);
assert (zmq_atomic_counter_dec (counter) == 0);
zmq_atomic_counter_destroy (&counter);
return 0;
